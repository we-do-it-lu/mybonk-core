# Baby rabbit holes

Ordered list of "basic" skills that need to be acquired to enjoy the ride.

Go through this slowly. It is tempting to speed-read through a book, call it done, and move on to the next book. To get the most out of this, take your time understanding each section. 

For every 5 minutes you spend reading you should spend 15 minutes tinkering around with what you just read. Break things. 

The sections "Commonly used" are examples you can easily copy/past.

A good *general* cheat sheet page:  [https://github.com/ruanbekker/cheatsheets#readme](https://github.com/ruanbekker/cheatsheets#readme)

    - ...

## Command line stuff

A *shell* is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. 

A *terminal* is a program that opens a graphical window and lets you interact with the shell.

A *CLI* (command-line interface) is what deal with when you interact with the shell. 


- Terminal vs. iTerm2 ([features](https://iterm2.com/features.html)).
  - iTerm2 hotkeys: 
    - toggle maximize window: `Cmd` + `Alt` + `=`
    - toggle full screen: `Cmd` + `Enter`.
    - make font larger: `Cmd` + `+`
    - make font smaller: `Cmd` + `-`
- Shell: 
  - The most important command on the command line is ```man``` (it stands for "manual", so [RTFM](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/RTFM)!).
  - ```bash``` and its history (sh, csh, tsh, ksh ...).
  - ```zsh``` adds great new features over ```bash```. (Note that as of macOS Catalina, the default shell in macOS is Zsh and Bash is deprecated), most noticeably:
    - Automatic cd: Just type the name of the directory without ``cd``.
    - Recursive path expansion: e.x. “/u/lo/b” expands to “/usr/local/bin”.
    - Spelling correction and approximate completion: Minor typo mistakes in file or directory names are fixed automatically.
    - Plugin and theme support: This is the greatest feature of Zsh. Use [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh#readme) manage these effortlessly (list of plugins [HERE](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins)).

- Environment variables in Linux-based systems:
  
    - Read ["how Environment Variables Work" (www.howtogeek.com/668503/how-to-set-environment-variables-in-bash-on-linux)](https://www.howtogeek.com/668503/how-to-set-environment-variables-in-bash-on-linux/)
    - ```$SHELL``` The default shell being used on the system.
    - ```$PATH``` Instructs the shell which directories to search for executables, it allows to run commands without having to specify its full path.
    - .etc... .
- Shell commands you must know *really well*:
  - ```ls```, ```cd```, ```type```, ```mkdir```, ```mv```, ```rm```, ```ln```, ```which```,  …
  - ```hostname```, ```whoami```, ```passwd```, ```chmod```, ```chgrp```, …
  - ```ip a```
  - ```history``` 
    - ```echo "$HISTFILE"```
    - ```history | grep [string]```: Find any record in history.
    - ```history -c```: Remove all records.
    - ```history -d 1234```: Remove record number 1234.
      - IMPORTANT: [In Zsh this command does not work](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/430640/history-d-does-not-remove-history-entry-but-shows-time-of-history-entry), it is an alias to ``fc`` which doesn't have an option to delete records from the history. <[workaround](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7243983/how-to-remove-an-entry-from-the-history-in-zsh/63494771#63494771)>
    




    - Don't forget to explore 'i-search' and 'reverse-i-search' using ``Ctrl`` + ``s`` and ``Ctrl`` + ``r`` respectively; Read this [if 'i-search' using ``Ctrl`` + ``s`` does not work](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/791765/unable-to-forward-search-bash-history-similarly-as-with-ctrl-r).
  - ```alias```
  - ```grep```: Find all files containing specific text
    - search all the files in a given directory:
    ```
        grep -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'pattern'
    ```
    - only search through those files with ```.c``` or ```.h``` extensions:
    ```
        grep --include=\*.{c,h} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
    ```
    - exclude searching all the files with ```.o``` extension:
    ```
        grep --exclude=\*.o -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
    ```
    - for directories it's possible to exclude one or more directories using the ```--exclude-dir``` parameter. For example, this will exclude the dirs ```dir1/ ```, ```dir2/``` and all of them matching ```*.dst```:
    ```
        grep --exclude-dir={dir1,dir2,*.dst} -rnw '/path/to/search/' -e "pattern"
    ```
    - ```sudo```
    - ```tee```: a command in command-line interpreters using standard streams which reads standard input and writes it to both standard output and one or more files, effectively duplicating its input. It is primarily used in conjunction with pipes and filters. The command is named after the T-splitter used in plumbing.
   - ```file```

## Text processing
- vi (cheat-sheet [HERE](https://www.thegeekdiary.com/basic-vi-commands-cheat-sheet/))
  - ```$ vi +132 myfile```: Open myfile on line 132
- sed ([https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html)): "stream editor" for editing streams of text too large to edit as a single file, or that might be generated on the fly as part of a larger data processing step: Substitution, replacing one block of text with another.
- awk ([https://github.com/onetrueawk/awk/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/onetrueawk/awk/blob/master/README.md)): Programming language. Unlike many conventional languages, awk is "data driven": you specify what kind of data you are interested in and the operations to be performed when that data is found.
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/): Lightweight and flexible command-line JSON parser/processor. [reference](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/tutorial/)
- [rg](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/ripgrep-linux-installation/#install-ripgrep-on-ubuntu-and-debian) (also known as ```ripgrep```): Recursively search the current directory for lines matching a pattern, very useful to find whatever document containing whatever text in whatever [sub]directory.
  - ```$ rg what_i_am_looking_for MyDoc_a.php MyDoc_b.php```   Look for string 'what_i_am_looking_for' in MyDoc_a.php and MyDoc_b.php
  - ```$ rg what_i_am_looking_for  MyDoc.php -C 2```: Return results with *context*, displaying 2 lines before and 2 lines after the match in the output. Also try the options ```-B``` and ```-A``` (number of lines *before* and *after* the match).
  - ```$ rg 'Error|Exception' MyDoc.php```: Searches the file for either ```Error``` or ```Exception```.
  - ```$ rg 't.p' MyDoc.php```: Looks for a ```t``` and a ```p``` with any single character in between.
  - ```$ rg ssl -i```: ***Recursively*** searches for instances of ssl in a case-insensitive manner.
  - ```$ rg service /etc/var/configuration.nix -i```: ***Recursively*** searches a specific directory for instances of *service* in a case-insensitive manner.
  - ```rg -g 'comp*'  key``` Searches only for the pattern ```key``` in files beginning with the substring ```comp```.
  - ```-l``` option to only list the files having a match without additional details/
  - ```-i``` option for case-insensitive search.
  - ```-S``` option for smart case search.
  - ```-F``` option to treat the search string as a string literal ([regex](https://docs.rs/regex/1.5.4/regex/#syntax) syntax).
  - ```$ rg --type-list``` List of the available file types.
  - ```$ rg key -t json``` Restricts the search for the pattern key to json files only.


## File system
- ```df```: Display disk usage (also checkout the ```glance```
utility).
  - ```df -hT```. ```-h``` for “human readable”, ```-T``` to displays the type of the filesystem.
  - ```df -hT -t ext4```. ```-t ext4``` to display only filesystems of type ext4.
  - ```df -hT -x squashfs -x overlay -x tmpfs -x devtmpfs``` to hide given filesystem types from the output.
- ```du```: Estimate file space usage.
## curl

## gpg, sha-256 …
## ssh & rsync
- [Difference between ssh and ~~Telnet~~](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-ssh-telnet/)
- [ssh](https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys/): 
  - OpenSSH
  - How to manage ssh keys
  - .ssh client configuration (```$HOME/.ssh/config```)
  - ssh-keygen
  - passphrase
  - ssh-copy-id: Copy your public key on the server machine in ```$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys``` 
  - ssh-add
  
  Also read about and setup ssh-agent, it will save you a LOT of time (key management, auto re-connect e.g. when your laptop goes to sleep or reboots ...).

- Network scanners: 
  - [findssh](https://github.com/scivision/findssh#readme): Command line tool to scan entire IPv4 subnet in less than 1 second. Without NMAP.

  Example:
  ```
  $ python3 -m findssh
  own address 192.168.0.7
  searching 192.168.0.0/24
  (IPv4Address('192.168.0.106'), 'SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.4p1 Debian-5+d')
  (IPv4Address('192.168.0.6'), 'SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.1')
  (IPv4Address('192.168.0.100'), 'SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.4')
  (IPv4Address('192.168.0.82'), 'SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.4p1 Debian-5+d')
  ```
  - [Angry IP Scanner](https://angryip.org/): Scans LAN and WAN, IP Range, Random or file in any format, provides GUI as well as CLI.
- [rsync](https://apoorvtyagi.tech/scp-command-in-linux): 
  - rsync uses a delta transfer algorithm and a few optimizations to make the operation a lot faster compared to ssh. The files that have been copied already won't be transferred again (unless they changed since). Can be run ad-hoc on the command line or configured to run as a deamon on the systems to keep files in sync.
  - rsync allows to restart failed transfers - you just reissue the same command and it will pick up where it left off, whereas scp will start again from scratch.
  - rsync needs to be used over SSH to be secure.

## NixOS commands reminder
- Nice Nix cheat sheet: [https://github.com/brainrake/nixos-tutorial/blob/master/cheatsheet.md](https://github.com/brainrake/nixos-tutorial/blob/master/cheatsheet.md)
- NixOS the "traditional" vs. the "Flakes" way: 

  - Flakes have been introduced with Nix 2.4
  - Although still flagged as "*experimental*" feature it is the way forward, we advise you to learn Flakes already.
- ```nix version```: Get running nix version (important as the MY₿ONK console might be running a different version from the one on MY₿ONK orchestrator).
- ```nix-shell```: Start an interactive shell based on a Nix expression. This is distinct from ```nix shell```.
- ```nix-build```: Build a Nix expression. This is distinct from ```nix build```.
- ```nix-channel```
- ```nix-collect-garbage```
- ```nix-copy-closure```
- ```nix-deamon```
- ```nix-env```
- ```nix-hash```
- ```nix-instantiate``` 
- ```nix-prefetch-url```
- ```nix-store```

- Use [```nix repl```](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_command/repl) to interactively explore the Nix language as well as configurations, options and packages in Nixpkgs.

  ![](img/various/nixrepl.png)

- Garbage collection:
  - Ref. the options ```keep-derivations``` (default: ```true```) and ```keep-outputs``` (default: ```false```) in the Nix configuration file.
  - ```nix-collect-garbage --delete-old```: Quick and easy way to clean up your system, deletes **all** old generations of **all** profiles in ```/nix/var/nix/profiles```. See the other options below for a more "surgical" way to garbage collect.
  - ```nix-env --delete-generations old```: Delete all old (non-current) generations of your current profile.
  - ```nix-env --delete-generations 10 11 23```: Delete a specific list of generations
  - ```nix-env --delete-generations 14d```: Delete all generations older than 14 days.
  - ```nix-store --gc --print-dead```: Display what files would be deleted.
  - ```nix-store --gc --print-live```: Display what files would not be deleted. 
  - After removing appropriate old generations (after having used ```nix-env``` with an argument ```--delete-generations```) - you can run the garbage collector as follows: ```nix-store --gc```
